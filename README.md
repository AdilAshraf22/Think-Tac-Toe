# 🎮 Overview

The Tic-Tac-Toe AI project is a Python-based game where players can challenge an AI opponent at different difficulty levels.
The game provides an intuitive console interface, using Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithms for AI decision-making.

Test your skills against Easy 🎲, Medium 🧠, or Hard 🔥 AI, and see if you can outsmart the unbeatable AI!

# 🚀 Features

✅ Three AI Difficulty Levels

• Easy Mode 🎲: AI selects moves randomly.

• Medium Mode 🧠: AI uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal decisions.

• Hard Mode 🔥: AI uses Alpha-Beta Pruning to improve Minimax efficiency.

✅ Human vs AI Mode (No multiplayer)

✅ Smart AI moves for a challenging experience

✅ Minimax Algorithm for unbeatable AI

✅ Alpha-Beta Pruning for optimized decision-making

✅ Simple Console Interface

# 🛠 Technologies Used

• Python 3.x: Programming language for game logic.

• Minimax Algorithm: AI strategy for optimal moves.

• Alpha-Beta Pruning: Optimization technique to speed up decision-making.

• Terminal-Based UI: Simple and clean gameplay interface.
